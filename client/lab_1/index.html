    <h1>JILL TRAN Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
    <!-- this is a small heading-->
    <h2>First, the basics.</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
    headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
      <li>but what is ligma?</li>
    </ul>

You should list your top 5 albums below. This is to show you know how to use a list element.

    <ol>
      <li>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R OST</li>
      <li>VA-11 HALL-A Cyberpunk Bartending OST</li>
      <li>The Gold Experience - The Artist Formerly Known As Prince</li>
      <li>Fire - Electric Six</li>
      <li>Breakbot (any album)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

      <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
      phrase.</p>

      <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
        of a word or phrase.</p>

      <p>Maybe you need a <em><strong>particular</strong></em> word to be read.</p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

      <p>Soft line breaks look very nice<br/>when you want something to actually look like a paragraph. <br/>
        Just don't like, <BR/> spam it in order to do a bunch of spacing. That looks ugly <br/> and it might brick something.</p>
